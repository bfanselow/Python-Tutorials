"""
 A context-manager is used for resource allocation in a "with" statement.
 When code reaches a "with" statement it allocates resources temporariliy. When
 the with statement blocks finsihes all the resources consumed by the with statement
 are relesed.

 A Context Manager requires two basic functions, __enter__() and __exit__().
 By defining these functions in a class we can use it alongside a "with" statement
 to provide optional resource allocation.

    def __enter__(self):

        Called when the "with" statement is entered.

        The parameters describe the exception that caused the context to be exited.
        If the context was exited without an exception, all three arguments will be None.
        If an exception is supplied, and the method wishes to suppress the exception
        (i.e., prevent it from being propagated), it should return a true value. Otherwise,
        the exception will be processed normally upon exit from this method.

# Implement the same pattern with @contextmanager decorator

#  * The section above the yield statement does what an __enter__() method does.
#  * The yield statement returns an iterator to the target in the with statements as clause.
#    At this stage, the control is passed to the with statement.
