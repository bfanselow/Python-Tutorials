# Mutable and Immutable Objects

### Identity   
An object's *identity* (equivelent to the object's memory address) in Python never changes once it has been created.
The identity of an object can be found with the **id()** function.   
```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> id(s)
139884406490368
```

The **is** operator can be used to compare the identity of objects   
```
>>> s2 = s
>>> s2 is s
True
>>> id(s2)
139884406490368
```

### Immutable Objects (int, float, decimal, bool, string, tuple, and range)
We say that a Python object is immutable if its **identity** changes when we change its value
```
>>> a = '1234'
>>> id(a)
139884406490368
>>> a = '12345'
>>> id(a)
139884406490424   # we actually created a new object rather than modifying the original!

>>> N = 34
>>> id(N)
139884405705664
>>> N +=1
>>> N
35
>>> id(N)
139884405705696  # we actually created a new object rather than modifying the original!
```

### Mutable Objects  (list, dictionary, set, and user-defined classes) 
We say that a Python object is mutable if we can change its value without changing its *identity*
```
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> id(l)
139884406486664
>>> l.append(4)
>>> id(l)
139884406486664  # We changed the value of the object without changing its identity!
```


### Comparing an object's **value** vs the object's identity   
The **==** operator compares object values, not identities.
Notice the the difference between immutable and mutable objects
```
# Immutable object's with same value share the same identity
>>> s3 = 'abc'
>>> s == s3
True
>>> s is s3
True

# Mutable object's with the same value do not necessarily share the same identity
>>> l = [1,2,3]
>>> l1 = [1,2,3]
>>> l == l1
True
>>> l is l1
False
```

### Copying immutable objects
If we copy an immutable object, the copy has the same identity as the original. However, if we change the copy, this does not change the original since the change actually created a new object (as we saw above).
```
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> id(s)
139884407143312
>>> s1 = s
>>> id(s1)
139884407143312
>>> s1 = 'abcd'
>>> s
'abc'

# Notice, the value of s was not changed when we modified s1.
# That is because by changing s1's value, we actually changed its identity
>>> id(s1)
139884406490704
```

### Copying mutable objects   
In contrast, if we copy a mutable object and make a change to the copy, this will also change the original.  BEWARE!
This makes sense as our change to the copy did not create a new object (as for immutable object copies).
```
>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
>>> id(l)
139884406488136
>>> l1 = l

# By copying we create a new object reference (almost like an "alias") having same identity

>>> id(l1)
139884406488136

# Change one changes BOTH since the change did not create a new object with different identity

>>> l.append(4)
>>> l1
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Using mutable objects as default function arg
Be very careful using mutable objects as default args in a function/method. Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if a mutable default argument is used and is mutated, it is mutated for all future calls to the function as well. This leads to buggy behaviour as the programmer expects the default value of that argument in each function call.

Example:
```
>>> def f(key, value, hash={}):
...     hash[key] = value
...     return hash

>>> print(f('a', 1))
{'a': 1}
>>> print(f('b', 2))
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Yikes! Did you expect the output to be {'b': 2}
```

#### You could argue that if your function does not change the value of the passed object then it's not a problem.  If the function does not modify the argument but leaks a reference to it (by returning it, yielding it, calling some other function with it as an argument, or so on), then the same problem can occur. It's recommended to always use None, even if the function is written carefully to avoid such bugs, purely so that seemingly-innocuous changes to the function cannot break it.

Better:
```
>>> def f(key, value, hash=None):
...     if not hash:
...         hash = {}
...     hash[key] = value
...     return hash

>>> print(f('a', 1))
{'a': 1}
>>> print(f('b', 2))
{'b': 2}
```
